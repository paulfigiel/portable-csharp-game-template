## üöÄ Portable C# Game Runtime Template

This project demonstrates how to use the **same C# code** for your game across multiple engines/frameworks.

Made to be used as a **template** for creating such portable projects.

### üåç Supported Platforms
- **Unity**
- **SDL3**

This allows you, for example, to:

- ‚úÖ Use **SDL3** or similar low-level frameworks for desktop platforms.

- ‚úÖ Utilize the **Unity runtime** as a host for your game runtime when porting to consoles, simplifying the porting process.

### üìö Libraries
The project leverages [**Arch ECS**](https://github.com/genaray/Arch) for architecture design.

üß† **Arch ECS** is a powerful and easy-to-use **Entity Component System** for C#. Highly recommended!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

    CoreGameProject[Core Game Project]
    
    UnityPlatform[Unity Platform-Specific Code]
    SDL3Platform[SDL3 Platform-Specific Code]

    CoreGameProject -- compiled --> CoreGameRuntime
    CoreGameProject -- compiled --> CoreGameRuntimeSDL3

    subgraph Unity Engine
        CoreGameRuntime[Core Game Runtime]
        UnityPlatform
    end

    subgraph CSharp Project
        CoreGameRuntimeSDL3[Core Game Runtime]
        SDL3Platform
    end

    CoreGameRuntime <-- ECS --> UnityPlatform
    CoreGameRuntimeSDL3 <-- ECS --> SDL3Platform
```

The [**Game Project**](Game/Game.csproj) is built as a **Library**.

This library can be used in:
- **Unity** ‚Äî See the [Unity Implementation](Unity%20Project/Assets/Unity%20Implementation/UnityModule.cs)

- **Regular C# Project** ‚Äî See the [SDL3 Implementation](Unity%20Project/Assets/Unity%20Implementation/UnityModule.cs)

## üéØ Cool Features in the SDL3 Target

### üî• Hot Reloading
Hot reloading comes **out of the box**, making it incredibly satisfying to work on your systems:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Native AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation)
On SDL3 target, **Native AOT** is enabled in release builds.

It produces a self-contained executable for easier distribution.
